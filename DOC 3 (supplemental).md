While I couldn't access the specific `simple.py` file from the oofoe/forthish repository, I can explain how a typical simple Forth interpreter works based on this educational implementation:

## How a Simple Forth Interpreter Works

A simple Forth interpreter in Python typically consists of several key components:

### **Core Architecture**

**Data Stack**: The "data stack" is the central feature, like the stove in your kitchen. And because we manipulate it directly, we have to compromise a little for the language. In Python, this is typically implemented as a simple list:

```python
ds = []  # Data stack implemented as Python list
```

**Dictionary**: A lookup table that maps Forth words to their corresponding Python functions:

```python
rDict = {
    '+': rAdd,
    '*': rMul,
    'dup': rDup,
    '.': rDot,
    # ... more words
}
```

### **Basic Stack Operations**


The fundamental operations manipulate the data stack directly:

```python
def rAdd(cod, p): 
    b = ds.pop(); a = ds.pop(); ds.append(a + b)

def rMul(cod, p): 
    b = ds.pop(); a = ds.pop(); ds.append(a * b)

def rSub(cod, p): 
    b = ds.pop(); a = ds.pop(); ds.append(a - b)

def rSwap(cod, p): 
    a = ds.pop(); b = ds.pop(); ds.append(a); ds.append(b)

def rDup(cod, p): 
    ds.append(ds[-1])

def rDot(cod, p): 
    print(ds.pop())
```

### **Postfix Notation**

Forth uses postfix notation and the need for parens simply disappears. Operators are simply placed where they are used in the computation. For example:
- `5 6 +` pushes 5, then 6, then adds them (result: 11)
- `5 6 + 7 8 + *` evaluates `(5+6)*(7+8)` = 165

### **Compilation Process**

The interpreter tokenizes input and compiles it to executable code:

```python
def compile():
    pcode = []
    while True:
        word = getWord()
        if word in rDict:
            pcode.append(rDict[word])
        else:
            # Try to parse as number
            try:
                pcode.append(rPush)
                pcode.append(int(word))
            except:
                # Handle as user-defined word
                pass
        return pcode
```

### **Word Definitions**

Every word definition starts with a ":" immediately followed by the word we want to define. Then everything following up to the closing ";" becomes the body of the definition:

```
: square dup * ;
```

This creates a new word "square" that duplicates the top of stack and multiplies.

### **Control Structures**

The interpreter supports control flow with compile-time words:

- **IF/THEN/ELSE**: Conditional execution
- **BEGIN/UNTIL**: Loops that continue until a condition is met

### **Memory Management**

Simple Forth implementations often include:
- **Variables**: Created with `CREATE` and `ALLOT`
- **Heap storage**: Using `@` (fetch) and `!` (store) operations

### **Execution Model**

Forth is a combination compiler and interpreter. The compiler translate source code not to machine code like we saw in the previous chapter, but into instructions for a "virtual" machine, which we'll refer to as "pcode".

The interpreter operates in two modes:
1. **Immediate mode**: Execute words as they're compiled
2. **Compile mode**: Build word definitions for later execution

This architecture makes Forth incredibly simple yet powerful - the entire interpreter can be implemented in just a few hundred lines of Python while providing a complete programming environment with variables, control structures, and extensibility through user-defined words.
