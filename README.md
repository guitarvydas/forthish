### Essential

* [ATLAST](https://www.fourmilab.ch/atlast/) -- My first encounter with this concept, written by the legendary John Walker. He explains it better than I can.
* [Starting Forth](https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/) -- Classic Forth tutorial and textbook. Don't be fooled by the illustrations, this book not only teaches you how to use Forth, but actually gives you enough information to write your own as well.
* [Levels of FORTH](https://www.forth.org/literature/forthlev.html) -- Glen Haydon's taxonomy of Forth implementations, slightly outdated, but useful if you're trying to figure out what functionality to implement next.

### Supplemental

* [JONESFORTH](https://github.com/nornagon/jonesforth/blob/master/jonesforth.S) -- A full implementation of Forth, in assembly.
* [Thinking Forth -- A Language and Philosophy for Solving Problems](https://www.forth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/thinking-forth-color.pdf) -- Leo Brodie's masterwork, read this to figure out how to _really_ use your new Forth implementation.
