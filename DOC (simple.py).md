This is a beautifully minimal implementation of a Forth-like stack-based interpreter in Python! Let me break down how it works:

## Core Components

**Global State:**

- `S = []` - The data stack (core of Forth)
- `BUFF` and `BUFP` - Input buffer and buffer pointer for parsing
- `D` - Dictionary mapping word names to Python functions

## Stack Operations

The interpreter uses standard Forth stack notation in comments:

- `( a b -- sum)` means: takes two items `a` and `b` from stack, leaves `sum` on stack
- `( --)` means: takes nothing, leaves nothing

**Key operations:**

- `xdot()` - Pops and prints top of stack (`.` in Forth)
- `xdots()` - Shows entire stack contents (`.s` in Forth)
- `xadd()` - Pops two numbers, pushes their sum
- `xswap()` - Swaps top two stack items
- `xsub()` - Subtraction (note the `xswap()` to get correct order)

## Parsing Engine

**`xword()`** is clever - it:

1. Pops a delimiter character from the stack
2. Reads characters from the input buffer until it finds that delimiter
3. Pushes the collected string onto the stack

**`xinterpret()`** executes words by:

1. Popping a word from the stack
2. Looking it up in dictionary `D` and calling the function
3. If not found but numeric, pushing the number onto stack
4. Otherwise printing an error

## The REPL

**`ok()`** implements the main loop:

1. Gets input from user
2. For each space-delimited token:
    - Pushes ASCII space (32) as delimiter
    - Calls `xword()` to extract the token
    - Calls `xinterpret()` to execute it

## Example Usage

```
OK 5 3 + .
8
OK 10 20 swap - .
-10
OK 1 2 3 .s
[1, 2, 3]
```

This is an elegant demonstration of how simple a stack-based language interpreter can be - just ~50 lines implementing the core concepts of Forth: stack manipulation, word lookup, and a simple parser. It's a great example of Paul Tarvydas's philosophy of programming simplicity!
